# Multiclass-Fish-Image-Classification
This project classifies different fish species from images using deep learning models. Various architectures including CNN and EfficientNetB0 were trained and evaluated, with EfficientNetB0 achieving the best accuracy. The model was integrated into a Streamlit web app for easy image-based fish species prediction.
